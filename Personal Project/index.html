        <h3>Consulting</h3>
        <p>Consulting is defined as the practise of providing a third party with expertise on a matter in exchange for a fee. The service may involve either advisory or implementation services. For the consultant, taking an independent and unbiased stance on an issue is central to his/her role. A consultant can, in principle, service any sector. Over the past few decades, however, the term has become synonymous with business advisory which focuses mostly on business strategy, management, organisation, operational processes and technology.</p>
